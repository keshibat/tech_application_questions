#### 2. Choose Your Own (Three) Questions

1. What is the difference between an Relational Database like MySQL and a NoSQL

> A relational database consists of one or more tables with columns and rows to organize data.  The relation between table called schema. 
Non-relational databases, on the other hand, are document-oriented. Unlike tables, which are responsible for a single type of data, they can store information under different categories, which all depend on different commands.

2. What are the benefits and drawbacks of a single-page application? When would you not want to use one?
>The browser doesn’t have to send the request to the server. In another word, does not require refreshing the page which leads users-experience more rich interactions and faster responses. 
Drawbacks would be low SEO potential and longer initial load. 
If the page requires a lot of user interactions with faster response. If the page prioritizes SEO, SPA is not easy to go higher ranking so consider server-side rendering.

>React hook lifecycles method are different from the class component lifecycle method but follows the same structure as below.
